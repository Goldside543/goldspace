# Preface
Hello, and welcome to the Goldspace User Manual! This manual is intended for use by the general public. If you are a developer, see the developer manual.

# Chapter I: Installing Goldspace
USB DRIVE: You'll typically use a program such as Rufus to make a bootable USB drive. Luckily, Goldspace distributions (are intended to) come in the form of a bootable ISO! Just follow the instructions in Rufus, and you'll be on your way! <br>
CD/DVD: Arguably, this is a bit easier. You'll have to use a disc image burner software to burn the Goldspace ISO to a disc. <br> <br>

# Chapter II: Using Goldspace
Goldspace is a kernel with a CLI. This means that you'll have to remember commands if you want to do things. Don't be discouraged! There's only three, and they're all outlined in the README, so I'm not gonna repeat myself here.

# Chapter III: Goldspace utilizations
Not really much right now, but here's an idea! You can quickly jot an idea down into the shell prompt, and be able to revisit it after a bit! If you want to clear it off, reboot the system! Boom, a real use-case!
