# Goldspace
Crappy kernel I'm making. We've got... dumbass boot Assembly thing, the core of the kernel, the linker, the shell, the Makefile... 
It's practically better than Linux.
# Gash
Now onto the shell, Gash. Gash is a portmanteau of "Gold" and "Bash", and is designed specifically for Goldspace. How the hell do I give it input, you ask? Well, the core of the kernel has a teeny little keyboard driver, and I'm not even sure it works.
