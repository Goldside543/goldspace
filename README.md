# Goldspace
Crappy kernel I'm making. We've got the bootloader, the kernel, the linker script, the Gash shell, the Makefile...
It's practically better than Linux.
# Gash
Now onto the shell, Gash. Gash is a portmanteau of "Gold" and "Bash", and is designed specifically for Goldspace. How the hell do I give it input, you ask? Well, the core of the kernel has a keyboard driver inside of it!
# Command list:
* `help` displays help.
* `clear` clears the screen.
* `echo <message>` allows you to type in something, and it'll be repeated!
* `create <filename>` creates a file!
* `write <filename> <data>` writes data to a file!
* `read <filename>` reads a file!
* `delete <filename>` deletes a file!
