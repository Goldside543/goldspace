# Goldspace
Crappy kernel I'm making. We've got the bootloader, the kernel, the linker script, the Gash shell, the Makefile...
It's practically better than Linux.
# Gash
Now onto the shell, Gash. Gash is a portmanteau of "Gold" and "Bash", and is designed specifically for Goldspace. How the hell do I give it input, you ask? Well, the core of the kernel has a keyboard driver inside of it!
# Command list:
* `h` displays help.
* `echo` allows you to type in something, and it'll be repeated! (not working as of v1.1.2)
* `c` clears the screen!
# For additional documentation...
See the user manual or developer manual, conveniently located in the Documentation directory!
# Version number: v1.1.3
