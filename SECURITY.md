## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, create an issue and detail the vulnerability. I will get to it ASAP.

# P.S.

As of Alpha 3.1.0, every version prior is now labeled as Alpha. In hindsight, not mentioning that it's in the alpha phase made Goldspace sound kind of like a complete kernel, when it totally isn't. <br> <br> <br>


Yet, that is. :)
